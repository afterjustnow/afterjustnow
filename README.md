- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @afterjustnow and I'm learning Data Analysis (SQL) and have a PSPO 1 certification from Scrum.org.
I'm interested in technical program mangaement, and looking forward to diving deep into the worlds of contemporary technology.
Very excited to work on a Scrum team in the future and a product owner.
